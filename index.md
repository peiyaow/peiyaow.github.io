I am currently a fourth year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Statistics and Operations Research](http://stat-or.unc.edu/) at [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](http://unc.edu/), under the supervision of Professor [Yufeng Liu](http://www.unc.edu/~yfliu/) and Professor [Dinggang Shen](https://www.med.unc.edu/radiology/copy_of_faculty-overview/shen/). Prior to UNC, I received a B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics From Fudan University, China in 2015.

Basically, I work on statistical modeling of heterogeneous data driven from the study of Alzheimer's Disease. On the methodology side, my research draws on nonparametric statistics and high dimensional data analysis. I am currently a research assistant in the [IDEA Group](https://www.med.unc.edu/bric/ideagroup) at [UNC School of Medicine](http://www.med.unc.edu/).

In my spare time, I enjoy swimming and cooking. I also have a passion on playing the ukuleles.
